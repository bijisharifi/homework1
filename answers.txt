What is the difference between a merge and a rebase?
Merging is a more straightforward method for combining branches, because it preserves their individual histories. Rebasing creates a more linear history of project modifications but it involves rewriting commit history, which can make things difficult for shared branches in a collaborative environment.  


What is a remote repository?
A remote repository is an important component of version control systems, which allow for collaboration, saving (backup), code review, and integration of changes.
